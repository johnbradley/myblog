          The goal of this was to learn more about polymer.
          The free github hosting doesn't refresh if index.html isn't changed every time.
          To work around this I modified gulpfile.js to add a comment timestamp to index.html.
          Using polymer for a blog like this is a little silly as it is mostly static data.
          The project was created with yeoman: 'yo polymer'.
          Using bower as a dependancy manager.
